Library Management System

Hello, in this C# project, there are both admin and user roles with specific functionalities:

User Roles:

Users can manage student book registrations and query students by their number, name, and class.
Additionally, users can add books to the system and search books by their number, title, and author.
Admin Roles:

The admin panel ensures the security of books by listing students who have not returned books after 15 days, along with their information.
Admins can query students by class, identify students who have or haven't returned books, and search for students within a specific number range.
Admins can also find students by entering the first letter of their name.
The system allows the creation of an Excel report for students who havenâ€™t returned books.
Admins can view active registered users and other admins.
